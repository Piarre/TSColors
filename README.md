## I had a problem to add color(s) to a typescript app so I have found a file with colors syntax
```
Reset = "\x1b[0m"
Bright = "\x1b[1m"
Dim = "\x1b[2m"
Underscore = "\x1b[4m"
Blink = "\x1b[5m"
Reverse = "\x1b[7m"
Hidden = "\x1b[8m"

FGBlack = "\x1b[30m"
FGRed = "\x1b[31m"
FGGreen = "\x1b[32m"
FGYellow = "\x1b[33m"
FGBlue = "\x1b[34m"
FGMagenta = "\x1b[35m"
FGCyan = "\x1b[36m"
FGWhite = "\x1b[37m"

BGBlack = "\x1b[40m"
BGRed = "\x1b[41m"
BGGreen = "\x1b[42m"
BGYellow = "\x1b[43m"
BGBlue = "\x1b[44m"
BGMagenta = "\x1b[45m"
BGCyan = "\x1b[46m"
BGWhite = "\x1b[47m"
```
## FB = ForeGround (The text color's) : BG = BackGround
